syakyou(写経)
=============

achiku's personal syakyou(sutra copying) project in an attempt to be a better programmer. 


I need to improve my programming skills, and decided to make this process more efficient by leaning from all the programming greats on GitHub.
Hand copying their code let me realize syntaxes that I don't know, class design that I've never imagine with the lowest cost.

It has been alway difficult to start and keep motivation for my own new project, or read and understand (I mean really understand) new books on technologies. 
Compared to above activities, syakyou seems much easier to keep doing on a daily basis.
