syakyou(写経)
=============

achiku's personal syakyou(sutra copying) project in an attempt to be a better programmer. I need to improve my skills, and decided to improve it efficiently by leaning from all the programming greats on GitHub by hand copying their code, not building my own new project, nor reading through new books.
