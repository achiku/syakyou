syakyou(写経)
=============

achiku's personal syakyou(sutra copying) project in an attempt to be a better programmer. I need to improve my skills, and decided to improve it efficiently by leaning from all the programming greats on GitHub by hand copying their code

It is sometimes difficult to build my own new project, or read and understand books on new technologies. Rather starting up new, it is much easier to learn and, more importantly, keep learning from what already working.
